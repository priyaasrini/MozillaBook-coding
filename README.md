This repository contains Priyaa's experimental code for the Mozilla book.

The code base covers: 

1. Coding using Algebraic dyanmics - directed and undirected wiring diagrams, discrete and continuous 
2. Javis - creating animations

You can try out these code in a Jupyter notebook on a browser using Binder -- except the code for Javis. Click the link below to launch a notebook. Once the notebook is launched, copy-paste the code to the notebook to run them! 

Launch binder with this kernel using this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/priyaasrini/AlgJulia-Book-Binder2/HEAD)

or copy-paste this URL into your browser window - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/priyaasrini/AlgJulia-Book-Binder2/HEAD 

If the kernel is built successfully, it will open a Jupyter-notebook in the browser window with all the packages in Project.toml and requirements.txt loaded!
